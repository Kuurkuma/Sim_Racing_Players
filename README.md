**Embarking on our journey to delve into the world of sim-racing games, we aim to achieve two key objectives:**

- Exploring historical trends in sim-racing games on Steam.
- Integrating real-time data from various platforms to capture current patterns and player activity

# Hostorical trends

## Introduction
The analysis aims to explore the historical trends of racing simulation games on the Steam platform between 2013 and 2023. The hypothesis posits that sim-racing games are experiencing increasing popularity over time. 

## Background
The Steam database serves as a rich source of historical gaming data, offering insights into user preferences and trends over time. By focusing on the top 10 "Automobile Sim" games on Steam from 2013 to 2023, provided in .csv format by the SteamDB website, we seek to unravel patterns and fluctuations in the popularity of racing simulation games.

## Analysis
Our analysis commences with an in-depth examination of historical data retrieved from the Steam platform. Through the exploration of Steam database records, we aim to identify trends, shifts, and recurrent patterns in the popularity of racing simulation games over the past decade.



## 2. Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly & Streamlit

After gathering and processing the data from SteamDB, we will utilize Plotly and Streamlit to build an interactive dashboard. This dashboard will provide users with an immersive experience, allowing them to explore the trends and patterns identified in our analysis. With Plotly's powerful visualization capabilities and Streamlit's user-friendly interface, users will be able to interact with the data, gaining insights into the popularity of sim-racing games over the years.

_(This will be a new project by itself)_

## 3.Integration of real-time data from various platforms via API calls:

We will then exploit real-time data streams from other services, including Steam, iRacing, marketplaces and publisher platforms. 

By leveraging the APIs provided by these platforms, we will have access to hourly player counts and more accurate information on current trends.

Through the combined analysis of historical data and real-time information, we hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of the past and present popularity of racing simulation games, and thus answer the hypothesis posed.
