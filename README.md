# Sim-racing real-time and historical data analysis:

![Global trend](https://github.com/Kuurkuma/sim-racing-players/blob/f3b18eb08e0d64fdd078d1d5b31ead61800c3eec/reports/figures/line_chart-global_trend.png)

*History of racing simulation games between 2013-2023 on Steam and integration of real-time data from various platforms*.

Hypothesis: "Sim-racing games are becoming increasingly popular".
To address this proposition, we will use a multi-faceted approach:

## 1.Analysis of Steam database for historical trends:

We will start by examining historical data from the Steam platform, focusing on the 10 most popular games labelled "Automobile Sim" from 2013 to 2023. The data comes from .csv files provided by the SteamDB website. Through this analysis, we aim to discover trends, patterns and fluctuations in the popularity of racing simulation games over the last decade.

## 2. Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly & Streamlit

After gathering and processing the data from SteamDB, we will utilize Plotly and Streamlit to build an interactive dashboard. This dashboard will provide users with an immersive experience, allowing them to explore the trends and patterns identified in our analysis. With Plotly's powerful visualization capabilities and Streamlit's user-friendly interface, users will be able to interact with the data, gaining insights into the popularity of sim-racing games over the years.

_(This will be a new project by itself)_

## 3.Integration of real-time data from various platforms via API calls:

We will then exploit real-time data streams from other services, including Steam, iRacing, marketplaces and publisher platforms. 

By leveraging the APIs provided by these platforms, we will have access to hourly player counts and more accurate information on current trends.

Through the combined analysis of historical data and real-time information, we hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of the past and present popularity of racing simulation games, and thus answer the hypothesis posed.
